# Around (Un-maintained)
A react native + node.js, location based messaging app.

Being my first projec in React Native, it has no consistent architecture and quite a lot of anti patterns. Published only becaused I felt that a public repo is a better resting place than a private one.

Developed and tested with only Android (which defeats the purpose of React Native but I prefered writing JS over Android) Project may or may not build.
